-- FOREIGN KEY on CREATE TABLE

-- Code Start
CREATE TABLE Orders (
  OrderId in NOT NULL,
  OrderNumber int NOT NULL,
  PersonID int,
  PRIMARY KEY (OrderID),
  FOREIGN KEY (PersonId) REFERENCES Persons(PersonID)
);
-- Code End

-- The code creates a FOREIGN KEY on the 'PersonID' column when the 'Orders' table is created

-- A FOREIGN KEY is a key used to link two tables together
-- A FOREIGN KEY is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table.
-- A table containing the foreign key is called the child table, and the table containing the candidate key is called the reference or parent table
-- The FOREIGN KEY constraint is used to prevent actions that would destroy links between tables
-- The FOREIGN KEY constraint also prevents invalid data from being inserted into the foreign key column, because it has to be one of the values contained in the table it points to.
