-- Create View Example

-- Code Start
CREATE VIEW [Brazil Customers] AS -- Customers from Brazil
SELECT CustomerName, ContactName
FROM Customers
WHERE Country = "Brazil";

-- A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database.
