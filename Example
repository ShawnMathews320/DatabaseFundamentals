--Use of READPAST(Scenario where a client wanted to display all the available

seats in their cinema hall which are not being processed.)



--Run these queries in order



*First query*

--Code Start

Use tempdb

GO



--Create a table with a few rows

Create table t1 (ID int)

Insert into t1 values (1),(2),(3),(4),(5)

GO



--Next create two side by side sessions

BEGIN TRANSACTION

Update t1

Set ID = ID

from t1

where ID in (1,2,5)

--Code end



--Start Output

(5 rows affected)



(3 rows affected)

--end



--Now run the second command



*Second query*

--Code Start

Use tempdb

GO



select *

from t1 (READPAST)

--Code end



-- When you run the above statement from line 677 to 678 the query will skip

all the lock rows and display the available rows.



--Start Output

ID

3

4

--end



--Two other possibilities instead of hint READPAST



1. Use No Hint - well, in that case, the second statemant would have waited a

long time and only produced results after the first result was committed or 

rolled back.



2. Use NoLock Hint - this was not a good idea as it would have displayed all

the rows which were still locked by users.



--READPAST hint was a perfect solution for this scenario because it skipped

all the locked rows
